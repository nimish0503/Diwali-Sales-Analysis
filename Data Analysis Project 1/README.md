<h1>Project Description: Diwali Sales Data Analysis</h1>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
The objective of this project is to analyze the sales data from a Diwali festival sale to gain insights into customer demographics, popular products, and purchasing patterns.

<h3>Data Source:</h3>
The data was sourced from a CSV file containing information such as gender, age group, state, marital status, occupation, product category, product ID, orders, and amount.

<h3>Methods:</h3>
Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The data was cleaned by dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to understand the distribution of sales across different demographics and product categories.

<h3>Results</h3>
The analysis revealed that most buyers were females, aged between 26-35 years, married, working in IT, Healthcare, or Aviation sectors, and were more likely to purchase products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka were the top states in terms of both orders and total sales.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
The project concludes that married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, are the primary target audience for sales during the Diwali festival, with a preference for products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
